Baseball Case Study :

Problem Statement:
This dataset utilizes data from 2014 Major League Baseball seasons in order to develop an algorithm that predicts the number of wins for a given team in the 2015 season based on several different indicators of success. There are 16 different features that will be used as the inputs to the machine learning and the output will be a value that represents the number of wins. 

-- Input features: Runs, At Bats, Hits, Doubles, Triples, Homeruns, Walks, Strikeouts, Stolen Bases, Runs Allowed, Earned Runs, Earned Run Average (ERA), Shutouts, Saves, Complete Games and Errors

-- Output: Number of predicted wins (W)

Avacado Project

Problem Statement:
Avocado is a fruit consumed by people heavily in the United States. 

Content
This data was downloaded from the Hass Avocado Board website in May of 2018 & compiled into a single CSV. 

The table below represents weekly 2018 retail scan data for National retail volume (units) and price. Retail scan data comes directly from retailers’ cash registers based on actual retail sales of Hass avocados. 

Starting in 2013, the table below reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units (avocados) are sold in bags. 

The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados. Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.

Some relevant columns in the dataset:

Date - The date of the observation
AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado
type - conventional or organic
year - the year
Region - the city or region of the observation
Total Volume - Total number of avocados sold
4046 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4046 sold
4225 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4225 sold
4770 - Total number of avocados with PLU 4770 sold


Inspiration /Label 

The dataset can be seen in two angles to find the region and find the average price .

Task: One of Classification and other of Regression

Do both tasks in the same .ipynb file and submit at single file.

HR Analytics Project- Understanding the Attrition in HR

Problem Statement:
Every year a lot of companies hire a number of employees. The companies invest time and money in training those employees, not just this but there are training programs within the companies for their existing employees as well. The aim of these programs is to increase the effectiveness of their employees. But where HR Analytics fit in this? and is it just about improving the performance of employees?

HR Analytics

Human resource analytics (HR analytics) is an area in the field of analytics that refers to applying analytic processes to the human resource department of an organization in the hope of improving employee performance and therefore getting a better return on investment. HR analytics does not just deal with gathering data on employee efficiency. Instead, it aims to provide insight into each process by gathering data and then using it to make relevant decisions about how to improve these processes.

Attrition in HR

Attrition in human resources refers to the gradual loss of employees overtime. In general, relatively high attrition is problematic for companies. HR professionals often assume a leadership role in designing company compensation programs, work culture, and motivation systems that help the organization retain top employees.

How does Attrition affect companies? and how does HR Analytics help in analyzing attrition? We will discuss the first question here and for the second question, we will write the code and try to understand the process step by step.

Attrition affecting Companies

A major problem in high employee attrition is its cost to an organization. Job postings, hiring processes, paperwork, and new hire training are some of the common expenses of losing employees and replacing them. Additionally, regular employee turnover prohibits your organization from increasing its collective knowledge base and experience over time. This is especially concerning if your business is customer-facing, as customers often prefer to interact with familiar people. Errors and issues are more likely if you constantly have new workers.
